Social Media App (React)

A React-based social media app built as a tutorial follow-along project, focused on understanding component structure, state management, dummy backend simulation, and API integration.
This project is not a production-ready clone — it’s a learning-focused implementation to strengthen frontend fundamentals and real-world data flow concepts.
